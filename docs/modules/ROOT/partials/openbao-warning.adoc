`component-openbao` leverages k8up's application specific backups to create OpenBao snapshots.
Restoring such a snapshot is only possible by providing the OpenBao https://openbao.org/docs/concepts/seal[unseal key] and https://openbao.org/docs/concepts/tokens/#root-tokens[root token].
As these are sensitive secrets, they are not backed up as part of the component's automated backup process.

When setting up OpenBao, you must store the OpenBao unseal key and root token in a safe location in order to be able to restore backups.

In a running OpenBao instance, both of these secrets can be found in the `[instance name]-seal` secret in the OpenBao instance's namespace.
In order to have a reliable OpenBao backup, this secret must be backed up separately to a safe location.
